# Movement-type-classification-by-using-EMG-data-and-LSTM
In the term project of Machine Learning class in Boğaziçi University, I used EMG data of 8 muscles from lower limb to perform task classification. The classification is binary, step-up tasks and the rest of the tasks are aimed to be classified. The dataset can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0323-z
